		I had the opportunity to collaborate with a group of individuals I had not previously worked
		with. We worked together to develop an application for IT/CS students to learn Swift programming
		language and iOS development. It encourage students to try developing iOS applications using
		Swift. We are fortunate enough to present our application in an exhibit at PHINMA-University or
		Pangasinan.
